# Game Study

This App Engine website was created for the study "Assessing the Effects of Online Anonymity on Dishonest Behavior". 
In a basic sense, the website has users play through a video game for a chance at a $25 cash prize. All users have the ability to cheat through the game, but some users receive an alert of surveillance while some do not. To make the idea of surveillance more convincing, the website uses Google's authentication system in order to match user to Google account. Users are alerted about the data they share before they sign in. 

The study found that the warning of surveillance had no significant impact on the rates of cheating through the game, but it did have an overwhelmingly large impact on the rate of another form of dishonest behavior: refreshing. At the end of the study, refreshing the page could enable one to receive another draw at the prize. Users that were not notified of surveillance refreshed at a much higher rate than those that did not.
